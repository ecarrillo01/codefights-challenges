        Note: Write a solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) additional space complexity, since this is what you would be asked
        to do during a real interview. Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find
        the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more
        than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second
        occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1. Example For a = [2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 2],
        the output should be firstDuplicate(a) = 3. There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has
        a smaller index than than second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3. For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should
        be firstDuplicate(a) = -1.
